## Description

The poll feature used to send user JIDs and names included in protocol messages, rather than derive from the XMPP session of the sender.
Consequently, anyone in the conference could send messages with fake senderId or voterId values, and arbitrarily forge polls and votes.

## Resolution

User JIDs and display names are no longer sent in the protocol messages and are taken from the XMPP session.
