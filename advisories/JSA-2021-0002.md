## Description
A Prosody module allows the use of symmetrical algorithms to validate JWTs. This
means that tokens generated by arbitrary sources can be used to gain

The module has been updated to not accept symmetrical algorithms as valid. The fix
is in this PR: https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/pull/9319
