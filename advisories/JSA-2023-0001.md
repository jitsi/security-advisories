## Overview

* **Project**: jitsi-videobridge
* **Summary**: Forging bridge channel messages
* **Severity**: Minor
* **Affected versions**: < 2.3.38
* **Fixed date**: 2023-08-08
* **Fixed version**: 2.3.38
* **CVE**: N/A
* **Reported by**: afewgoats on HackerOne

## Description

The JSON parser in jitsi-videobridge handles duplicate keys inconsistently,
using the first occurrence to determine the type, but serializing both values.
Since browsers use the last occurrence of a key, this can be used to forward a
message with an attacker-specified type to an endpoint.

## Resolution

The JSON parser was fixed to not serialize duplicate values.
