## Overview

* **Project**: jitsi-meet
* **Summary**:  Meeting password disclosed when lobby member is accepted
* **Severity**: Low
* **Affected versions**: All
* **Fixed date**: 2024-03-21
* **Fixed version**: 2.0.9457
* **CVE**: CVE-2024-33530
* **Reported by**: Florian Port

## Description

The lobby mode allows moderators to restrict access to a conference to either users who provide the ephemeral password for the meeting, or users that are individually allowed by a moderator. The flow that allowed a user in without a password was found to disclose the password as part of the protocol messages, allowing the user to share the password with others or re-join if kicked.

## Resolution

The password is no longer disclosed as part of the lobby member acceptance workflow.
